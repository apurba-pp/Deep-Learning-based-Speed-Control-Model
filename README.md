# Deep-Learning-based-Speed-Controller-Model
This a trained deep learning model, which uses reinforcement learning. A simple problem solved the DL way!!!

### What is achieved with this model?
<b>Let's understand with an example:</b><br>
There is a autonomous car whose speed can range between 0 to 120 km/hr. In economy mode, the car runs at a speed of 55-65 km/hr. When the car is travelling at speed of 55-65 km/hr there would be instances when this speed will be changed due to mild variation in road slope (50-70km/hr). At that point my car needs to know whether to accelerate or to de-accelerate to retain back its speed between 55-65 km/hr in minimum possible time. Here is when this trained model guides me to whether accelerate or de-accelerate.
 
 <b>NOTE:</b> A simple code can solve this issue by looking up at the current speed and according accelerate or de-accelerate using some if-else statements.
